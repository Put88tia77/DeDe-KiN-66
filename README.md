Modular design, or modularity this is what I found its all about AI .
in the context of GPTand natural language processing( NLP ) in general, 
" changing texts into numbers " refers to the process of converting textual dada into numerical
representations that machine learning models like GPT can understand and processs. This processes 
known as text encoding or tokenization. This is really fascinating.
